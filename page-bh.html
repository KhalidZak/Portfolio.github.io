            <p class="ka--p1">At Berry I’ve navigated some of the biggest challenges of my career so far. Joining
                the<br>
                business in september 2015 in its early seed stage, I became the sole product designer<br>
                in early 2016. From here I laid the foundations of the Monese product and visual design,<br>
                hired, grew and lead the design team to a height of 19 amazing designers across 3<br>countries.</p>
            <p class="ka--p2">I implemented a series of design practices including design sprints and ideation<br>
                sessions, design critiques, user testing, design system and documentation libraries with<br>
                regular system catchups to keep knowledge sharing flowing, and maintain speed and<br>
                consistency across the product org as we scaled.</p>
            <p class="ka--p3">Working closely with agile teams across the product, including User Researchers,<br>
                Designers, Engineers, Product Leads and Data Scientists, we collectively pursued the<br>
                goal of measuring and improving the customer experience and driving key business<br>
                metrics such as growth, revenue and retention.</p>

                Chronic and urgent medical conditions are a major issue in the healthcare system, <br>

                Many people are hesitant to speak with a medical professional about their health<br>

                Unfortunately, this reluctance to seek medical attention contributes to higher mortality<br>

        <h2>Design thinking</h2>
        <p>Putting pen to paper and getting my ideas out as quickly as possible with the <br>
            information I had gathered was the best way to easily create multiple layouts<br>
            and share with the team for reviews and see what needed improvements.</p>

        <h2>wireframing</h2>
        <p>Feeling confident in my progress, I rapidly developed low-fidelity wireframes to test<br>
            with the team. These wireframes prioritized functionality over aesthetics, enabling us to<br>
            quickly iterate and identify any areas for improvement in the user experience.</p>

        <h2>Clinician design</h2>
        <p>The clinician design was created with the doctors in mind, ensuring that the product<br>
            offer flexibility and accessibility to patients’ medical information and history. This <br>
            allows doctors to conduct consultations with patients using chat, audio or video<br>
            interviews, while also enabling them to prescribe drugs as needed.</p>

            to show to both clinician and patients. So after several iteration we set one strict rule<br>
            all page must adhere to the trio view style.</p>

            with responsive instead of adaptive view.</p>
